SynFloSifteo1.0App
==================

An interactive installation that illustrates core concepts of synthetic biology through playful tangible interaction.

Open the solution in EcoliTest and open SiftDev to run it on actual cubes.

If you don't have cubes, you can run it through Siftulator.

If you want to use the surface component, you will need to update the IP Address variable: Searching for the IP shoud get you to it. The IP must also be updated in the surface app.
